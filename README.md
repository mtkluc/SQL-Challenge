# SQL-Challenge

This challenge is Week 9's challenge for the Data Visualisation/Analytics course.

Within this challenge I have visualised an ERD from the CSV files provided.
Used pgAdmin to load these to a database
And queried the database to answer specific questions.

Additional help was sought to correct code by ChatGPT and through my colleagues.
